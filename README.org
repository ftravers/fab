* FAB Re-Frame Starter Project 

[Fenton](https://github.com/ftravers) and [Alex's](https://github.com/aeberts) re-frame starter project.

This is a full-stack, single-page application starter project based on re-frame and Datomic Free. 
The goal of this project is to explore a modern clj/cljs-centric web application architecture and to serve as a solid base project that can be used to quickly prototype ideas. This readme not only serves as a guide to using the project but also as a repository for notes, background and rationale for the choices we made during development.  

This is being developed on MacOS and Linux and while it may work on Windows, there are no plans to officially support it (sorry).

* Project Architecture

What follows is a detailed explanation of each component of the system. The goal
is to provide enough information so that a beginner Clojure(script) web developer can understand
the responsibilities of each component in this system and be able to swap them
out with libraries of their own choosing if necessary.

The tech stack below was chosen based on the following criteria:
  * Support for modern (bleeding edge?) technologies and protocols (which may
    mean that it is not supported by all browsers)
  * Clojure and Java-centric choices (i.e. choose good Clojure(script) options
    when available e.g. Transit vs JSON)
  * Where possible prefer options that are data-oriented and declarative in
    nature (i.e. "say what should be done" vs. "do what I say")
  * Use simple, modular components where possible to make substitution of
    modules easier
  * Use components that favour ease of use over performance (i.e. ones that
    don't require extensive configuration and work OOTB)

** Build Tools

*** Leiningen

*** shadow-cljs

shadow-cljs allows easy use of javascript libraries without having to provide "externs" files. The primary maintainer of shadow-cljs Tomas Heller (@thheller) is very active in maintaining shadow-cljs and pushes useful new features regularly. 

Other development benefits of shadow-cljs are:
  * hot code reloading
  * cljs inspectors
  
*** BinaryAge cljs-devtools : https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools
- cljs-devtools provides some enhancements for cljs developers using Chrome:
- Better formatting of cljs values in Chrome's DevTools console
- More informative exceptions
- Long stack traces of async calls

** Web Server: HTTP-Kit

*** What is a web server?

Most developers know what a web server is and how it works but bear
with me, the discussion below is relevant and Clojure(script) related.

A web server is designed to store and deliver web pages to browsers
(a.k.a. "Clients" or "User Agents") via HTTP. Web servers can refer to
the physical hardware that responds to HTTP requests or the software
running on a physical server somewhere. While the type of hardware
your server is running on is important for performance we're mostly
interested in the web server software and how it interacts with you
Clojure(script) application.

Eric Normand did a great write-up of Clojure web servers here:
https://purelyfunctional.tv/mini-guide/clojure-web-servers/

Peter Taoussains published some benchmarks of the major clojure web
servers here:
https://github.com/ptaoussanis/clojure-web-server-benchmarks/tree/master/results
The benchmarks are 5 years old but the results are still interesting
and relevant.

While not the fastest of java or clojure web servers we chose http-kit
for this project because it is simple to use, supports the Ring spec,
has limited dependencies and can be extended to support more exotic
configurations.

*** What is this Ring thing and do we need it?

If you are exploring developing web applications in Clojure you will
no doubt have run across references to Ring. But what is Ring and why
should I care about it? Ring is Clojure web application library which
abstracts the details of HTTP into a simple Clojure API. You can think
of Ring as more of an interface or specification of the components
that are needed for a web application. The full spec is on Github, if
you're interested in the details. The benefit of using Ring is that
libraries that implement the Ring specification are modular and can
all work together.

*** Other Web Server Options:

**** Pedestal/Jetty (http://pedestal.io/index)

Pedestal/Jetty is another great web server option for Clojure apps but
we went with http-kit for this project because it's a little simpler
to configure out of the box and has fewer dependencies.

** Application Server

Simple clojure applications do not need a separate application
per-se. The clojure code in clj and cljc files is called by handlers
from the web server (in our case http-kit) and returns responses to
the client via the web server. The clojure application is started by
the "traditional" methods i.e. via leiningen.

** System Lifecycle Management : Integrant

Note: Integrant support is not yet implemented

What is system lifecycle management? (SLM)

Any client / server system contains multiple components: servers,
databases, application servers, etc. Even in small systems, these
separate components must be supplied with a particular configuration
and started and stopped in a particular order. System lifecycle
management libraries are useful to orchestrate the startup and
shutdown of these separate compoents.

There are many clojure-based SLM libraries available (Integrant,
Component, Mount, Duct, etc.) - what responsibilities do they have and
how do they work?
     
(TBC)
     
Why did we choose Integrant?
  * Regularly maintained
  * Declarative and data-driven
  * Dependencies are resolved from the configuration before the system
    is initialized

** Back-End Router: Reitit (TBC)

*** What is a back-end router?

A back-end router is part of your application server and is the component that
decides how to respond to web requests received from a client (for example the
the client application running in a browser). Back-end routers can respond to
simple "static" routes which respond to urls that have no additional details
(e.g. "http://yoursite.com/home") or more complicated "dynamic" routes where
details are provided (e.g. "http://yoursite.com/users/42"). Back in the "old
days" of the internet when web pages were mostly rendered on the server,
back-end routers translated inbound web requests into application logic, fetched
whatever data was required, filled in HTML templates with the data and returned
the response to the client browser to be displayed.

As web applications became more interactive, more of the work for
rendering the client UI was done in the client browser.

*** What features does a back-end router need to have?

*** What are the "nice to have" features of a back-end router?

*** Why did we choose reitit as our back-end routing library?

*** What other options are there?

*** Compojure : https://github.com/weavejester/compojure

*** Secretary

*** Bidi

*** Clerk

*** Accountant


** Back-End Database: Datomic

(TBD)

** Front-End Router: Reitit (TBC)

*** What is a front-end router?

Single Page Applications (SPAs) often only have one back-end route which
supplies a simple index.html file and the applications javascript files. The
application's UI and all logic is rendered by a javascript library in the
browser (e.g. React) and the back-end is mostly responsible for other tasks such
as interacting with databases or 3rd-party services (e.g. like marketing mail
servers). In practice, front-end routers are primarily responsible for managing
what views an application renders when the user requests a particular URL. There
are other

A front-end router is responsible for:
 * Interpreting or "resolving" URIs
 * Handling the case where the user clicks the browser's "back" or "forward" buttons
 * Managing HTML5 pushState

*** What features does a front-end router need to have?

(TBD)

What are the "nice to have" features?

*** Why did we choose reitit as our front-end routing library?

What is HTML5 pushState?

** Front-End UI Framework : Re-frame

(TBD)

** Deployment : Heroku

- Push to git repo on Heroku and you're done.
- Free tier available
- Supports custom domains

** Testing

(TBD)

* Todo's

*** TODO AE find out what dev-after-load (reagent thing)

*** TODO AE shadow-cljs command to build production 
   (for integration with heroku deployment)

   Target: must be able to create a *.js file somewhere (advanced
   compilation?), so can be served up in production.

*** TODO AE setup local-prod
 We have three envs (at least): dev, local-prod, deploy-prod (remote, real)

*** TODO AE get tracing working for production, stubs.

*** TODO FT checkout logging with transducers for application
 where they keep the last 3 states, for a function call.

*** TODO AE make links/nav work with reitit
have a link on home page to another page, and back again.

*** TODO AE Fix bad navigation does 404 or something...

*** TODO AE coercion is breaking page??
(ns fab.router
   [reitit.coercion.spec :as rcs]

*** TODO Get history (back/forward) buttons working push state
use-fragment = false...

*** TODO AE there is a circular reference problem with main-page view

*** TODO FT Get shadow FE working with Cider.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(ns fab.router
...
   {:use-fragment true}))
#+END_SRC

* Meeting: May 24, 2020
** Agenda
*** DONE AE to demo reitit

*** DONE FT Share AERO config, secrets.edn for storing passwords etc...

** Meeting Minutes
** Discussions

*** Web Server
AE likes http-kit.  FT heard rumors about it...
options: http-kit.  

Decision: Stick with Ring/Jetty until more of the base is solidified.

http-kit: pure clojure solution, supports WebSockets.
pedestal: batteries included (framework-y), too heavyweight.
ring-jetty: doesn't support WebSockets out-of-the-box.

*** BE Routing
Compojure maybe but doesn't support WebSockets.
Reitit seems better and works FE/BE. Mostly setup for FE.

Decision: Stick with Reitit

** Decisions
*** Web Server: 
Stick with Ring/Jetty but try to move towards http-kit.

** Future Agenda Items
*** A testing story FE&BE.
*** bring together shadow & heroku
Integrate everything that we have ATM.
**** TODO FE get cider working with shadow
*** FE/BE ??? Authentication
    
*** Testing FE/BE

some trivial change.
